##1. <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>

###1.1 <a name="purpose">Purpose</a>
The intent of this document is to convey the architectural decisions that have been made for the "Marauder's Map" application. Included is an overview of the system, and several different views to show the different aspects of the application.

###1.2 <a name="scope">Scope</a>
Contained in this document is information relating to the overall architectural design of the "Marauder's Map" application, including the structure of the data capture node, data processing server, coordinate calculation, and display interface.

###1.3 <a name="definitions">Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations</a>
####Erlang
A general-purpose concurrent, garbage-collected programming language and runtime system. The sequential subset of Erlang is a functional language, with eager evaluation, single assignment , and dynamic typing. It was designed by Ericsson to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, non-stop applications. It supports hot swapping, so that code can be changed without stopping a system. The "Marauder's Map" uses it for the capture nodes and data processing server. 

####Triangulation/Trilateration
The process of determining absolute or relative locations of points by measurement of distances, using the geometry of circles, spheres or triangles.

####Fingerprinting
The process of creating a many-to-one mapping of multiple test data points into one real data point. For our purposes, we calibrated our algorithm by standing in various positions around the map and saying "This is where we are now. Data from this point looks like X, so anything that looks like X in the future is from this point."

##2. <a name="representation">Architectural Representation</a>
To provide a deeper understanding into the design of the Marauder Map application, the following sections are organized around several different architectural views of the system: 

   -   The Logical view will provide an overview of the components and subsystems.
   -   The Deployment view describes how the application will be deployed.
   -   The Implementation view goes into more detail of the objects and subsystems of the application.
   -   The Data view will show in what way the data from the application is stored, organized, and accessed.

##3. <a name="goals">Architectural Goals and Constraints</a>

###3.1 <a name="privacy">Privacy</a>
- Collected data must not be stored in any permanent storage. The system must use data as it is collected, and then immediately discard it.
- The system must not make use of any data that can be use for identification purposes, or use any data that is not readily available via public analysis. 

###3.2 <a name="accuracy">Accuracy</a>
- Accuracy of data and calculation algorithm is a must. The system must be able
	to display device locations on the map with an error of no more than 10
	meters. 
- Device locations must be reflected on the map in near real time with a
	refresh rate of 500 milliseconds or less.

###3.3 <a name="flexibility">System Flexibility</a>
- This project must be modifiable and flexible for future design goals, such
	as: integration with larger displays, addition of more capture nodes to
	increase precision, or the ability to identify a device as being owned by
	a user if they so choose.
- All modules must be designed in isolation, such that changing one module
	should not propagate it's changes to the other modules requiring additional
	work. 

- The display interface must be designed such that it will be possible to
	display the map on different operating systems and devices (Mac OSX,
	Windows, Androidâ€¦)
	
###3.4 <a name="performance">Performance</a>
- System must be able to collect a large amount of data and display multiple
	different device locations on the map in near real time (less than 500 
	milliseconds).
- System must be reliable enough to provide over 90% uptime in a typical server
	environment of 40 hours per week.
	
##4. <a name="logical">Logical View</a>

Marauder's Map is divided into two large sections: *Back-End* and *Front-End*

#### Back-End
The Back-End is non-user facing and consists of nine major components: Receiver,
Analyzer, Python Signal Analyzer, WebSocket Server, Application Supervisor, Mnesia,
gproc, jsx, and a set of Capture Nodes.

##### Receiver
The Receiver listens for incoming Wifi Signal data from a set of Capture Nodes
and tabulates the signal strengths for each particular WiFi packet. Upon 
collecting a "complete" packet (one that consists of at least 3 signal strengths),
it sends the completed packet to the Analyzer for analysis.

##### Analyzer
The Analyzer consists of two subcomponents: trainer and analyzer. It parses the
packets sent by the Receiver and divides them into two broad classes: a general
packet (sent by a generic device by a member of the general public) and a trainer
packet (sent by a set of specific MAC addresses belonging to the devices of
the developers of Marauder's Map).

General packets are sent to the Python Signal Analyzer to be analyzed. It expects
a return of x, y coordinate data. When the Python Signal Analyzer returns
coordinate data, the Analyzer will broadcast the location data to all connected
Map clients.

Trainer packets are stored in the mm_training table of the Mnesia database. Once
collated, the training data can be dumped into a text file to serve as calibration
data for the Python Signal Analyzer.

##### Python Signal Analyzer
The Python Signal Analyzer calibrates itself with training data from the Analyzer
and performs matrix analysis to find the closest coordinates that match the wireless
signature in a packet.

##### WebSocket Server
The WebSocket Server handles all WebSocket requests from the Front-End clients:
Map and Trainer tool. It acts as the intermediary between the Erlang Back-End and
the Javascript/HTML Front-End clients.

Every WebSocket process registers itself as a subscriber of a pubsub (Publisher-Subscriber)
gproc (global process manager) in order to receive broadcasts of location data
published by the Analyzer.

Data is packed into JSON objects which conform to an event-handling protocol that
is recognized by the Front-End clients. The jsx library is used for the encoding
and decoding of JSON data to Erlang terms.

##### Application Supervisor
The Application Supervisor is an Erlang OTP (Open Telecom Platform) behavior that
monitors the Analyzer, WebSocket Server, Receiver, Mnesia, gproc, and jsx. It
ensures uptime on the components and restarts those components in the event of
failure and errors are logged for administrative purposes.

By conforming to the Erlang OTP specifications, Marauder's Map can be run on the
OTP platform, and is supplemented with high uptime and reliability, comprehensive error
logging and robust failover facilities. 

##### Mnesia
Mnesia is a distributed database that is developed for use within the Erlang OTP.
It provides distributed table-based database capabilities and can function in
memory-only, disk-persisted, and a combination of both modes.

The Mnesia database runs as a separate process and maintains the `mm_training` and
`mm_trained_coord` tables. `mm_training` stores in tuple form the x,y coordinates and
signal strengths of those coordinates for use as calibration data in the Python 
Signal Analyzer. `mm_trained_coord` stores trained coordinates to prevent
duplication of data for identical coordinates.

##### gproc
gproc is a global process manager that encapsulates messaging between processes
in a more flexible form than Erlang's innate message passing abilities. It allows
for easy implementation of the PubSub protocol (Publisher-Subscriber) that
the Analyzer uses to broadcast location data to all connected WebSocket clients.

By abstracting this functionality to a third-party library, development and
maintainance requirements are reduced and we can expect a good level of reliability
from the component.

##### jsx
jsx is an Erlang-JSON encoder/decoder library. Marauder's Map uses JSON objects
to encapsulate event data and location data as the main form of communication between
the Back-End and the Front-End.

JSON is a widely-used and highly portable specification that allows for reduced 
development time in both the Back-End encoding components and Front-Ent decoding
functions. By using the third-party jsx library, one can ensure code reliability
and reduced development pressure.

##### Capture Nodes
The Capture Nodes is a set of computers which run the capture node portion of 
Marauder's Map. Each node is an Erlang Node (a virtual machine) that runs
tshark, the command-line component of Wireshark, to sniff wireless data from the air.

The Capture Nodes encapsulate the sniffing behavior provided by tshark and adds
blacklisting and whitelisting capabilities to filter out unwanted data. This ensures
no privacy violations occur from the general public not wanting their data to be
tracked by Marauder's Map.

#### Front-End
The Front-End is user facing and consists of two major components: Map and
Trainer.

##### Map 
Accessed through a web browser on a large, public, flatscreen display, it
receives data from the Back-End in near-realtime over WebSockets and utilizes
Javascript ([D3.js](http://www.d3js.org)) to animate and display location data on the screen.

##### Trainer
Accessed through a modern web browser on a computer or mobile device, this tool
provides the administrator an interface to collect WiFi fingerprinting training
data.

##5. <a name="deployment">Deployment View</a>
A minimum of 3 computers are required for deployment of Marauder's Map. Ideally,
4 computers are required for maximum functionality and reduced troubleshooting.

### The Server Node
The Server Node will host in its Erlang OTP environment the bulk of the Marauder's
Map application. The following services are run on the Server Node:

* Receiver - Receives data from Capture Nodes
* Analyzer - Sorts data from Receiver to be trained or signal-analyzed by Python
* Python Signal Analyzer - Analyzes signal data and calibrates itself with data from Analyzer
* Web Server - Serves HTTP to Front-End components
* WebSocket Server - Provides interface between Front-End and Back-End components
* Mnesia - Persists training data from Analyzer
* Application Supervisor - Monitors all components on the Server Node
* gproc - Provides PubSub functionality for data broadcasts
* jsx - Encodes and Decodes JSON data

### The Capture Nodes
The Capture Nodes will each host an Erlang environment that will capture wireless
data using tshark. The following services are run on the Capture Nodes:

* Capture - Captures output from tshark and packages it for consumption on the Analyzer
* tshark - Actual capturing of WiFi packets, with configuration and black/white listing functionality by Capture
